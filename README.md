This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Ada related to assigning array slices to subtypes. The `bug.ada` file contains code that exhibits this problem. The `bugSolution.ada` file presents a corrected version.  The core issue involves the implicit conversion during assignment between an array slice and a subtype with stricter bounds. This can lead to runtime errors or incorrect program behavior. The solution illustrates how to handle such assignments safely and correctly within Ada's type system.
